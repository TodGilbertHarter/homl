Carholtha is an adult white dragon which lives high in the /ARTICLEREF /REFNAME ./AlconPass.html REFNAME/ /REFTEXT Alcon Pass REFTEXT/ ARTICLEREF/ in a glacier which sites on the southern rim of the western side of the pass. The wyrm is satisfied mostly with raiding hobgoblins. This is partly true because it fears conflict with the green dragon of the /ARTICLEREF /REFNAME ./ForestOfGrin.html REFNAME/  /REFTEXT Forest of Grin REFTEXT/ ARTICLEREF/ . Lately the hobgoblins have been paying tribute to the dragon to allow them to pass. However /ARTICLEREF /REFNAME ./NomogGea.html REFNAME/  /REFTEXT Nomog-Gea REFTEXT/ ARTICLEREF/  has paid Carholtha off to close the pass while he undermines the authority of /ARTICLEREF /REFNAME ./AkothMagog.html REFNAME/  /REFTEXT Akoth-Magog REFTEXT/ ARTICLEREF/ .

Carholtha has a son who is currently ensconced in the caves beneath the old dwarven fortress near the top of pass.
