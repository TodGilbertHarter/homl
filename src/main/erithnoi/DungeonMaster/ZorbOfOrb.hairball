A famous wizard who disappeared a number of years ago.

Zorb was known as an avid student of the great and almost unknown magi of the southern continent. He is rumored to have originally come from ancient Mnaria. He built a holding in the Town of Tisloch in Kinergh and was often seen traveling through Gilduin and in the Eldoran Isles. Apparently he vanished about 15 years ago while adventuring in Alcon. His daughter the wizardess Talia has taken over his legacy.
