The Eliath Lond or Southern Range is a range of mountains in the southern part of the Midrealms. It extends from the middle portion of the peninsula of Erk north and east across the northern tier of Erklond. It is known to be inhabited by tribes of Goliaths and also some humanoids and other monsters. Overall it is a wild and uninhabited range of fairly steep mountains. Most of the area is remote from human and demi-human habitation. Since the Orc War of the 940's with Farlond the area has been quiet. Most of the orc tribes involved were defeated and many of the survivors moved north into the Eliath Dun.
