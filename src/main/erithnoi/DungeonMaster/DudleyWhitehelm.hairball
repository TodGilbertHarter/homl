/RIGHT /IMAGE DudleyWhitehelm.png IMAGE/ RIGHT/ Sir Dudley is a well-known and highly regarded paladin dedicated to the cause of the god Atur, the god of Kings and Law. However he was exposed to the forces of chaos while entrapped by the vile Lamia, the daughter of The /ARTICLEREF /REFNAME url:http://www.giantelectronicbrain.com/twiki/bin/view/DungeonMaster/GreenAdept /TD/  /TD/ class="twikiLink" REFNAME/ /REFTEXT GreenAdept REFTEXT/ ARTICLEREF/ . Later he was also imprisoned for a time by /ARTICLEREF /REFNAME url:http://www.giantelectronicbrain.com/twiki/bin/view/DungeonMaster/BarandOfFortunato /TD/  /TD/ class="twikiLink" REFNAME/ /REFTEXT BarandOfFortunato REFTEXT/ ARTICLEREF/  while investigating the activities of Barand's followers. While he appears to retain his allegiances to his god he has in fact become deeply disturbed, or possibly cursed. Dudley now sees the answer to the problems of the world in terms of establishing the absolute rule of a single 'just kingdom' by subjection of all Erithnoi to one ruler. He forthrightly holds out this vision in terms of justice and equity, though if closely questioned as to its ultimate wisdom or morality he may resort to simply refusing to discuss the details. In fact this notion was put into his head by The /ARTICLEREF /REFNAME url:http://www.giantelectronicbrain.com/twiki/bin/view/DungeonMaster/HeadOfObothNai /TD/  /TD/ class="twikiLink" REFNAME/ /REFTEXT HeadOfObothNai REFTEXT/ ARTICLEREF/  as a way of fostering both the eternal war desired by the followers of Nomok and as a backup plan for Barand's takeover of Gilduin.

Dudley will champion the idea of elevating the Duke/King of Kinergh and the Kingdom itself to the status of a great power by means of conquest at any reasonable opportunity. He will work diligently towards this end, encouraging /ARTICLEREF /REFNAME url:http://www.giantelectronicbrain.com/twiki/bin/view/DungeonMaster/SharnKellionII /TD/  /TD/ class="twikiLink" REFNAME/ /REFTEXT SharnKellionII REFTEXT/ ARTICLEREF/  to this point of view. Eventually if the Duke proves not to be the proper leader for this endeavor he will seek to find a replacement of some sort from amongst other legitimate pretenders. He may even simply take this 'burden' onto himself. In any case he will probably slowly become more and more unreasonably fixated on the 'glorious cause' until he becomes entirely unhinged and plunges into the depths of evil in the name of good.

Dudley will use his Sanction of Atur to mark the most dangerous foe he is facing, forcing that enemy to concentrate its attacks on him. He will employ his Fanatical Burst to hold down a whole group of enemies. He will use Lay on Hands to heal any ally whom he is unable to protect directly. Dudley will never leave allies to their fates, but he will retreat if faced with overwhelming odds.
