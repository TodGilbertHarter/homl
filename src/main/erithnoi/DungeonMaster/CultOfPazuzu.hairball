Pazuzu is one of the most insidious and subtle of demon lords. His cult regularly ensnares unwitting victims, corrupting and destroying them. From time-to-time some powerful wizard or other figure is netted in the schemes of the Lord of the Air. Currently the GreenAdept is the most important adherent of Pazuzu.
