A castle hidden in the vast forests of southern Farlond. It was once held by the /ARTICLEREF /REFNAME ./OrderofTheGriffin.html REFNAME/  /REFTEXT Order of the Griffin REFTEXT/ ARTICLEREF/ , but is now the lair of the green dragon Om-Vertithrax. Since the dragon's demise less than a year ago, the castle has remained largely empty. A few of his green kobolds remain there, but they have little power.
