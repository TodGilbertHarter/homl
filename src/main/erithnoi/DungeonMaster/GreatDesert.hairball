The Great Desert is a vast region lying far to the south of Erithnoi in the heart of the southern continent. Virtually nothing is known of this region in Erithnoi. In the distant past, during the ages of the Kingdom of Civari, this region was more hospitable. In those days a great kingdom, Pa, existed in the south-eastern portion of the desert. While Pa survived the destruction of Civari, it fell into decay in later centuries. At the same time the desert regions became even drier and advanced further to the south. All that remains of Pa today are ancient ruins, strange pyramids, and fearsome undead.
The southern edge of the desert is marked by a great river. There are still many towns and a few cities in this region, inhabited by people of mixed heritage, some descendants of the ancient race of Pa, and others related to the tribal groups living even further to the south.
