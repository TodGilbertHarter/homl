Talia is probably the most powerful single wizard alive in the Kinergh today. Many years ago her father ZorbOfOrb, a famous magician from the far southern lands, settled in Tisloch and built a tower. He was lost almost 10 years ago when Talia was 14 in some kind of magical expedition or experiment. Talia had already demonstrated a great talent for magical learning and after her father's death she continued to study under the tutelage of the Summoner Moondume, a member of the OrderOfTravelingMagi and an associate of Zorb's. At the age of 18 she assisted a group of adventurers including Dudley Whitehelm whom the Duke of Tisloch had recruited. This group was subsequently organized as /ARTICLEREF /REFNAME ./SilverCompany.html REFNAME/  /REFTEXT The Silver Company REFTEXT/ ARTICLEREF/  and Talia (who had a crush on Dudley) donated the use of part of her tower as a headquarters for the group.
