The Green Adept is a powerful evil mage who was responsible for a humanoid invasion of northern Kinergh in the year 1000. For several years his forces ravaged this area. They were finally defeated in battle in the fall of 1003 by the combined arms of the various lords of Kinergh with support from the dwarves of /ARTICLEREF /REFNAME ./Dalcaroth.html REFNAME/  /REFTEXT Dalcaroth REFTEXT/ ARTICLEREF/  and the elves of /ARTICLEREF /REFNAME ../Player/HighHold.html REFNAME/  /REFTEXT High Hold REFTEXT/ ARTICLEREF/ . After the Green Adept's army was defeated in battle he fled back to the /ARTICLEREF /REFNAME ./ForestOfGrin.html REFNAME/  /REFTEXT Forest of Grin REFTEXT/ ARTICLEREF/  where his main power base was located. A group of adventurers from the /ARTICLEREF /REFNAME ./SilverCompany.html REFNAME/  /REFTEXT Silver Company REFTEXT/ ARTICLEREF/  pursued him into the forest and ambushed and killed him at his army camp.

The group then attacked /ARTICLEREF /REFNAME ./CliffHold.html REFNAME/  /REFTEXT Cliff Hold REFTEXT/ ARTICLEREF/  and killed many of its inhabitants. Unfortunately some of them escaped and using the power of the /ARTICLEREF /REFNAME ./GreatFane.html REFNAME/  /REFTEXT Great Fane REFTEXT/ ARTICLEREF/  they were able to give the Green Adept back a semblance of life using foul rituals and calling upon powerful evil beings. Unknown to the inhabitants of Kinergh the evil forces have regained some of their strength and now have some even more powerful magics and allies to assist them in their plans.

The Green Adept himself has returned to life in the form of a Larva Mage, a foul undead being of considerable power. In addition he retains much of his original arcane might and has added some new powers. Even so his physical form is weaker than it was before death and his undead status means he is vulnerable to certain types of magic.

Undeath has also given the Green Adept a somewhat different perspective. While he is no less determined to conquer Kinergh and rule over as much of Erithnoi as he can he is more inclined to act slowly and methodically by rebuilding his power and strengthening his control over his allies.
