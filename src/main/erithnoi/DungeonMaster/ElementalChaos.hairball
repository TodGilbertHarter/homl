This is very much as described in the 4e D&D //Manual of the Planes//. The chaos may be eternal or not, but in any case it is physically unbounded. The Elder Gods (aka Primordials) are native to this realm. While many of these beings were destroyed or imprisoned during their war with the Younger Gods, some of them and many of their former minions, continue to exist.
