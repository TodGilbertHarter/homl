Amaranth is a silver elder wyrm which makes its lair in the high peak above the dwarven city of Dalcaroth. While 
the dragon has defended the city in the past it has grown sleepy of late and has not stirred visibly from its 
lair in 50 years. Now evil dragons of the north have begun to encroach further south than of old. It is rumored 
that Amaranth is still active through agents, but there are also rumors that the dragon is dead or otherwise 
incapacitated.
/SECTION Lore SECTION/ 

Streetwise: DC30 Amaranth is known to have entrusted several dwarves of incorruptible integrity to maintain its 
contacts. It is not known if they receive instructions from the dragon or if they are simply operating based on their 
own resources and knowledge of the dragon's wishes.

Streetwise: DC35 There is at least one dwarven adventurer who has been known to let it slip that Amaranth itself 
gives advice to certain highly trusted adventurers. Strangely it is difficult to get anyone to confirm this tale, 
but that may be accomplished with the use of other skills.

Streetwise: DC40 Amaranth still lives, but he expended a great deal of energy in a fight with an ancient white 
worm, Xagras, 65 years ago. Since then he has retired from active defense and remains within his lair. At 
times he will awaken and is said to have given some trusted persons telepathic access to him. He rarely sees 
anyone directly and prefers that his condition is not known. He is still capable of fighting, but believes his 
next fight will be his last.
/CHAPTER History CHAPTER/

Amaranth is one of, and possibly the, oldest living mortal creature in Erithnoi. He is almost 10 thousand years old. 
Born near the end of the war between the Younger and Elder Gods which destroyed the First World he was amongst the 
first to make the journey to Erth. He can remember the day when Olorin opened the ways and mortal races first came 
to the untamed world and the gods walked amongst them for the last time. Soon he will be gone and with him all 
living memory of those times.

Later Amaranth participated in the (% class="twikiNewLink" %)DragonWars(%%) and finally joined with the ancient 
dwarves of the north in their war against the giants who had enslaved them. At one time he made his lair at the 
base of the great central shaft of Alcon and advised the kings of Civari. When Civari fell he was instrumental in 
reestablishing the northern dwarves in Dalcaroth where he now lairs.

When the Cardolans first came to the west of Erithnoi Amaranth, already vastly ancient, gave them much of his 
knowledge. The mages of the /ARTICLEREF /REFNAME ./WhiteOrder.html REFNAME/ /REFTEXT White Order /REFTEXT ARTICLEREF/
in particular learned many secrets and 
Amaranth hoped that the empire they upheld would finally bring a great age of peace and learning. All too soon 
the empire crumbled and Amaranth retreated to his lair. Since those days he has spent his waning strength only 
to help secure and defend his ancient dwarven allies in Dalcaroth and now barely stirs at all.
