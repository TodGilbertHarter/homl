The old ones are ancient and timeless beings. They first came into existence when time began, and may even predate time itself. It is said that the Old Ones have always existed and always will exist. Unlike the other gods the Old Ones do not seek out or need followers. They care nothing for worship and do not in fact even care if they have priests or worshipers. At times they may manifest themselves in various fashions for unknown purposes. In essence The Old Ones are completely foreign to the modern thinking races and totally indifferent to them. Their names and aspects are largely unknown and only a few tales tell of them. From time to time various groups have built temples to The Old Ones and performed certain rites which have allowed them to manifest priestly powers or warlock pacts with these beings. Such groups are generally very secretive or in remote places. The Old Ones are essentially beyond mortal concepts of good and evil, but they are fundamentally antithetical to all normal life in the world and any who deal with them are likely to become warped and insane.

According to some lore the skies beyond the Sun and the Moons are simply a great infinite gulf extending to the edge of the cosmos itself. Tales tell of power mad or foolish magic users who have studied and had commerce with that which dwells in the far stars. Even the names of these beings are uncertain and only hinted at in ancient texts. A select few dedicated heroes have also made it their mission to insure that the influence of these strange powers is stamped out wherever it appears on Ergh.
