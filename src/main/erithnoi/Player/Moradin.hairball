Moradin is the patron god of dwarves and the god of the smithy. He is also the patron of many crafts which involve processing materials such as metal and stone. Moradin is said to have created the dwarves far back in the days of the war between the younger and elder gods. The dwarves say that Moradin was the first god and that the dwarves were the first of the civilized races to be created. Most other races discount these stories. While most dwarves worship Moradin as the father of their race and their highest moral authority he is also acknowledged by craftsmen of some other races as well, particularly humans. Moradin is considered an ally of Atur and the two are typically depicted as having been created at the same time (sometimes Corellon is also included as a third co-equal god).

In dwarvish communities there are regular priests and temples to Moradin. In non-dwarven lands smiths and some other craftsmen maintain shrines and perform sacrifices to Moradin, but large temples are rare. His priests are responsible for upholding the laws of the clans and guilds of the dwarves, protecting dwarven society against external dangers, and generally upholding dwarvish traditional community life.

Moradin and his priests are often unfriendly but not actively hostile to Corellon and his followers. They are the deadly enemies of Gruumsh and everything he stands for. They are on relatively good terms with the priesthoods of Nomok, Klay, Lir, and Teala, and are great allies of the priests of Atur.
