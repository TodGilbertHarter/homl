<content>Khem is a land which lies to the west of Vye-Elek and northwest of the Holburgs. It is populated by a large nation of nomads, the Khemish. Only one city is known to exist in Khem, the city of Khemkal. This is the seat of power of the Oronate of Khem, who's King claims to be the monarch of the Khemish nation. In the past the Khemish often raided or invaded Gilduin and even Kinergh. In more recent times they have settled down somewhat, although there are still occasional skimishes and raids into Gilduin. Traders making their way to Khemkal often bring back goods said to originate in lands many weeks journey further to the west. Nothing exact is known about these fabled western lands, and even the extent of Khemish territory in the west is unknown.</content></xwikidoc>
