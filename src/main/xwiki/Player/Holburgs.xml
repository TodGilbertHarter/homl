<content>The area known as the Holburgs is found on the western edge of Kinergh. At its center is a small mountainous area under which is situated the great dwarven City of Dalcaroth, and the whole area is under the rulership of Dalcaroth. Surrounding the central mountain area is a region of fertile hills and small deep valleys which is inhabited by a mixture of dwarves, halflings, gnomes, and humans. At the northern edge of The Holburgs is a great dwarven stronghold, Yzimath. Yzimath is the western terminus of the Old Cardolan Road which runs east to the Town of Tisloch in Kinergh. Another road, built by the dwarves, runs north from Yzimath, crosses the Holbrook River near Dinford, and after passing the fortress of Morkend, goes north into the southwestern edge of the Melthian Mountains, where ancient dwarven mines are located.</content></xwikidoc>
