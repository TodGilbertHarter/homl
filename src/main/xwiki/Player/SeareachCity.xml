<content>Located at the mouth of the Beldethian River Seareach City is one of the great seafaring ports of Erithnoi. The city is ruled by the Taalyi Sea Lords, a number of eldar clans which are famous as sailors and merchants. The city was founded over 1400 years ago when a group of eldar were stranded by a worldfall in the swampy lagoon to the east of the mouth of the Beldethian. The eldar simply built wooden platforms beneath their towers, which hang some 30-40' above the water. The city is home to eldar, Kernyi elves, and the mysterious race of Kenku. Some haflings, humans, and half-elves also call Seareach City home.
