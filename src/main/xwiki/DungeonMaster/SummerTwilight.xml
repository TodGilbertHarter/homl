<content>Summer Twilight is a druidic priest of Yilliki who is the leader of the moderate faction of Yilliki worshippers in Kinergh. She is opposed to the more radical faction who control Tlin-A-Yilliki who desire to expel most organized human settlement from areas north of the [[Holbrook River&gt;&gt;HolbrookRiver]] .

Summer appears at first glance to be a rather superficial character, dressing in a fringed leather jacket and breeches, liberally decorated with beadwork, a decorative headband, and wearing a number of pieces of decorative bead jewelry. Anyone who has to deal with her will soon find out that she is a very no-nonsense practical person who has considerable adventuring experience. She was part of several expeditions into the [[Forest of Grin&gt;&gt;ForestOfGrin]] as well as the [[Ruins of Alcon&gt;&gt;RuinsOfAlcon]] with [[Dudley Whitehelm&gt;&gt;DudleyWhitehelm]]. She has good contacts with the [[Rose Court&gt;&gt;RoseCourt]] at Tiliniel and has been working to maintain peaceful relations between the court nobility and the followers of Yilliki.

Her own faction is small but controls [[Tlin Loman&gt;&gt;TlinLoman]] in Western Har.</content></xwikidoc>
