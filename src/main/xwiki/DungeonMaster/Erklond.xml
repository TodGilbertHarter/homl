<content>Erklond is a territory which includes the [[peninsula of Erk&gt;&gt;doc:PenninsulaOfErk]], the Eliath Lond range, and all the land to the east as far as the [[Zel River&gt;&gt;doc:ZelRiver]]. The only major habitation in this area is the [[Town of Kellhold&gt;&gt;doc:Kellhold]]. The lord of Kelhold, Duke Harngrist of Malan, nominally claims all of Erklond but in fact his writ only extends to the area immediately around the town. [[Old Street &gt;&gt;doc:OldStreet]]runs almost due west from Kelhold across the northern reach of Erklond connecting with [[Olethia&gt;&gt;doc:Olethia]] in the [[Duchy of Blar&gt;&gt;doc:DuchyOfBlar]]. Duke Harngrist sends patrols up Old Street as far as the border with Blar now and then to help keep the road open, but the northwest of Erklond is a remote country and travel is not safe. One inn, The Forsaken Traveler, is located at the crossing of the Lond River. This outpost is often frequented by hunters, trappers, traveling merchants, and other less savory characters.

The human population of Erklond amounts to some 30,000 people in and around Kellhold. Beyond 30 miles from the town there are only a very few scattered farms, hunting lodges, and trapper cabins. Humanoid raiders are known to come down out of the Eliath Lond at times and the land is not safe.</content></xwikidoc>
