== Plot ==

Magnus was a fierce rival of the Eaglir clan of Sea Lords. In particular Methalion, a warlock and ship captain, competed for the trade of Sardek, a city in Minar famous for its wines (and also for its decadence). Magnus was able to acquire several highly lucrative exclusive contracts at Methalion's expense. In return Methalion used forbidden Eldar magic in an attempt to rectify his fortunes. The result was that several members of the Eaglir clan were struck down and cursed with Vampirism. Methalion himself escaped, but was forced into exile from Seareach City by the Sea Lords.

With Methalion out of the way Magnus thought his fortunes were secure, but over the course of several years Magnus discovered that Methalion's cursed relatives were preying on his ships and men. Eventually Magnus was brought to the brink of ruin. It was then that he came upon ancient lore which spoke of a weapon of light, the Wondrous Lantern, which would defeat his enemies. The Lantern was looted from the Temple of Lir in Sardis four centuries ago by the Evil Warlord Silder El Las. Lir subsequently cursed El Las, who then fell under the influence of the RedQueen and became a vampire. The book Magnus acquired, The Annals of Pundis Tral, goes on to tell how El Las was eventually banished to the Black Isle in the Bay of Minar.

Magnus decided that his best chance of redeeming his fortunes was to recover the Lantern from Silder El Las' horde. Unfortunately a spy,

== Notes ==

Braegar the Witch lives in a village on the Isle of Elgol, she knows about the Black Island. The treasure is found under a stone tree in the center of the land, protected by a 'dark spirit'.

== Adventures ==

=== Fate of the Grey Falcon ===

The party is making its way towards the Black Isle in the hopes of finding the treasure Magnus sought. Their cutter, the Dolphin's Eye, is being pursued by an Eldar vessel of the Eaglir. As the Dolphin makes its way through a heavy storm the crew sights a strange ship, its sails are ragged and an erie light shines forth from its rigging, while no sign of any living sailor can be seen upon its decks.</content></xwikidoc>
