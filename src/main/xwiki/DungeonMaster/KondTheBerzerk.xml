<content>Also known as "Berzerkond" he rules the [[County of Morkend&gt;&gt;doc:CountyOfMorkend]]. Kond is known as a fearsome figure, a barbarian out of the wilds of the far north who wields a great battleaxe with deadly effect. He has held the Castle of Morkend against repeated assaults by the dwarves of Dalcaroth. Since the defeat of the Green Adept however he has come to an accommodation with the dwarves, allowing their mining parties and ore shipments access to the dwarf road and the bridge he controls over the Holbrook River in exchange for tolls. Kond is known to employ goblin and hobgoblin mercenaries as his main fighting force and they terribly oppress the human population of the County.</content></xwikidoc>
