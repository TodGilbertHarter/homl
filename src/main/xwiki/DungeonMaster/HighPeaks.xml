<content>At the far western edge of Erithnoi lies a high range of peaks. Beyond these mountains are the lands to the west, sometimes known as Ya, or Ya Mashita. Actually Ya is considerably further west, but these lands are poorly known to the people of Erithnoi. North and north-east of these mountains is [[Khem&gt;&gt;Khem]], which forms the northern border region of Erithnoi. These mountains are quite steep and rather lofty, forming a single main ridge with several lesser ranges on their eastern sides. The western faces of the main range are quite sheer, forming a significant barrier to any travel. 
Several sub-ranges exist. The northern-most end of the main range turns due west and runs for about 200 miles. This range is known as the Withered Mountains. It is famous for being inhabited by several fearsome red dragons, which make the surrounding lands quite dangerous. For this reason travellers usually go further north into Khem. An eastern spur also exists, which runs along the border of Ek, and between these is a great valley. This valley is inhabited by a race of stone giants.

Far to the south another sub-range exists on the western side of the main High Peaks. This range is substantial, with a long valley between it and the main range. It is known as the Dwarrow Mountains, and is inhabited by a race of dwarves known as the Dwarrow. These dwarves claim unbroken descent from the ancient clans who first colonized all of the High Peaks 1000's of years ago. In truth those ancient dwarves long ago admixed with others from the south and east, their original cities were lost, and the Dwarrow are at most their cousins, though a few lines can genuinely trace their lineage back to those distant times. Overall they are an overly proud and difficult people, mostly content to remain within their mountain homes and nearby areas. They do trade with some nations further to the west, but only on a limited basis. They virtually no contact with Erithnoi proper.</content></xwikidoc>
