<content>Halden Marsh is the commander of the Duke's army. He is responsible for all the details of organization, equipment and training which allow the forces of the duchy to be marshaled in time of war. He oversees the Duchy's knights and insures that they and their men-at-arms are properly equipped and trained, supervising their organization into companies, assignment of officers etc. The militia are also under his authority when called up for service and he insures that they also receive the proper training and equipment. Finally his most important responsibility is commanding the army in the field whenever the Duke himself is not in direct command. Marsh is a competent and experienced veteran. He fully looks the part of the professional soldier he is and has no patience for those who are all talk and no action. Under his direction the companies of the Duchy's army have been equipped and trained to the highest standards possible within the limits of available resources. Over the last 3 years he has successfully lead the army in several battles against the Green Adept's forces. Now that this threat appears to be abated he has become embroiled in more and more in debates with Lefar over reducing the size and cost of the army. Marsh believes that more troubles are likely and that cutting back is unwise.</content></xwikidoc>
