TRAITS/
Wizards are pure students of the magic of the cosmos. Without entirely limiting themselves to one power source, they study and utilize all of them in some measure. This requires a great deal of mental discipline and constant study and practice. The wizard must also seek out and gain access to the information which they need to master in order to command the power sources without becoming attuned to a given one. Often they will be found wandering in far lands, strange worlds, or dark regions of the earth in search of this knowledge.

The path of true wizardry is long and hard. Many wizards eventually become tired of its rigours and effectively become practitioners of one or another of the specific power sources, essentially taking up a second calling within that source and abandoning much of their wizardly practice. Others simply become casualties of their need to explore and research into dangerous places and topics. Either way the higher ranks of wizardry are rarely achieved and the names of the few mighty ones who have become true archmages are spoken in awe.

/BENEFIT
You may spend power points as if you were attuned to a power source by first spending a single power point. You have to do this each time you want to utilize power of a source you are not attuned to. Instead of spending this power point, you may instead reduce your hit points by your healing value.
