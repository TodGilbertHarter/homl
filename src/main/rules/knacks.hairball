The chapter /REF How to Play REF/ contains the /REF Checks and Actions REF/ rules, which explain that when a player announces 
an action for his hero, the GM will determine, based on the action and intent, which aspect is governing that check, and 
thus which Knack is appropriate. If the hero has proficiency with that Knack, then they will gain a proficiency modifier 
on the resulting check. The hero will also benefit from their ability modifier for the relevant ability, etc. as explained under 
/REF Checks and Actions REF/ .
/SECTION" Aspect Descriptions "/

Each Aspect describes an area of endeavor and style of action. The GM can use the following descriptions to determine which 
aspect is governing a specific action, and the players can use them to decide which knacks to give their hero's proficiency in. 
As a result each hero will generally favor certain approaches to problem solving and excel in different ways. 
/SUBSECTION" Defensive Use"/

Knacks can act as defenses. When a hero is attacked or otherwise subject to harm, a defensive check is called for.
A player may propose the use of a knack as a defense, such as Acrobatics in order to dodge. Note that in this case the possible
outcomes are not generally as favorable as those which might result from the defensive use of a feat. The following feat block 
describes defensive knack use in terms of the general results which can be achieved.

SUBSECTION/
/SUBSECTION" Stealthy "/
/KNACK /ID" bd191df8-63ce-11ee-a1f1-c87f5455cfcc"/ /KNACKNAME Stealth KNACKNAME/ /KNACKABILITYMOD DEX KNACKABILITYMOD/ KNACK/

The stealthy aspect governs all attempts to hide, sneak, conceal, or ambush. 
/TOPIC" Hiding"/

A character can become hidden by making a Stealth check. This check will produce a result, which remains in effect until the character stops being hidden for some reason. The character will be hidden from NPCs if his check result exceeds the DV of the NPC's perception, which is their level's DV + WIS + proficiency bonus; it may appear in the knacks section of some monster's stat blocks if they are proficient. When PCs are trying to spot a hidden NPC they use either an active perception check, or a passive perception check may be employed if the character is not actively attempting to spot hidden things. The DV is creature level + DEX + proficiency bonus. Again, a stealth proficiency bonus will usually be noted in the knacks section of monster stat blocks.

In order for a character to become hidden she must have cover or concealment, be out of the line of sight of the character she is attempting to hide from; or be unseen due to invisibility, darkness or some other circumstance. If one of these conditions is not met, then hiding is impossible; but note that the conditions may be met with respect to some characters and not others. A character may become hidden only from some of its opponents.

If a character makes an attack or uses a feat on a target which has an effect on that target then he becomes visible to the target at the end of that action. If a hidden character moves into the line of sight of another character and lacks cover or concealment and is not unseen, then he becomes visible immediately and loses the benefits of being hidden at the end of his current action (IE for the duration of the action any attacks against him still suffer disadvantage and the character may claim to be hidden for other rules purposes). If a character makes a significant noise (talking, shouting, etc, but not whispering) then she is no longer hidden. If a character has a light source in a dark area then she cannot hide and is no longer hidden as soon as the light is manifested.

If a hidden character moves, then it may be detected. Movement of less than 3 squares in a turn will not reveal the character, but any movement of three or more squares requires making a new stealth check, with disadvantage.

Outside of action sequences stealth might be employed without concealment, as long as the character is out of the normal line of sight of another the check can be made and the other character will not notice them if it is successful. Alert characters are hard to sneak up on, and inattentive ones might be quite easy.

Stealth could be used to hide things besides a character. It could be used to conceal tracks, to camouflage something, etc. These checks work essentially in the same fashion outlined above. The feasibility and amount of time required, and any possible adjustments to the check result are up to the GM.

/KNACK /ID" f4b87222-63ce-11ee-9005-c87f5455cfcc"/ /KNACKNAME Streetwise KNACKNAME/ /KNACKABILITYMOD CHA KNACKABILITYMOD/ KNACK/

/SECTION" Proficiency"/

Characters will have proficiency with certain knacks, based on their calling, possibly species, and granted by some boons. For example, a character might have stealth proficiency. In this case, they will get a proficiency modifier of +5 when they carry out an action governed by the stealthy aspect. As described in the rules for making checks, proficiency always grants a +5 bonus.
/SUBSECTION" Boons"/

The following boons exist which can give a character a proficiency bonus. There are also many other boons which can incidentally grant these things. These may be granted whenever a character spends time in a situation where they may learn something.

/SECTION" Other Proficiencies"/

Beyond a character's knacks, they may also be good at certain specific things. In particular the use of tools, weapons, and implements are subject to proficiency bonuses.
/SUBSECTION" Tools"/

Any category of equipment might be the subject of proficiency. For example a given character might be an expert with all sorts of climbing gear. This character would gain a proficiency bonus on checks related to using this sort of gear, that is ropes, pitons, carabiners, grappling hooks, etc. Another character might have proficiency with lockpicking tools, etc.
SUBSECTION/
/SUBSECTION" Professions"/

Some characters may be specifically experts in certain fields of knowledge. While knacks will provide access to a certain amount of general knowledge proficiency, a character might also have very specific types of information, probably related to some sort of profession or similar life activity. Thus a character who is a farmer has specific knowledge of local crops, domestic animals, and farming implements and techniques.
SUBSECTION/
/SUBSECTION" Weapons"/

This is a very significant area of expertise. Some characters will have specific knowledge in the use of particular weapons, granting them a proficiency bonus when using the weapon in combat. In order to gain the bonus, the character must have the weapon in hand. Note that there are some restrictions here, the weapon must actually be a valid weapon for use in the specific type of attack being made. If the weapon is used defensively, then again, it must be appropriate, you cannot use a bow against close attacks for example.
SUBSECTION/
/SUBSECTION" Implements"/

Implements are magical instruments which are used with some feats. They are virtually identical to weapons in terms of the rules governing them, and some implements actually make reasonable weapons (and vice versa). Use of implements on the defensive is possible, but note that having implement proficiency with a specific item is not interchangeable with weapon proficiency with the same item. Thus a wizard with staff implement proficiency won't be able to claim the proficiency bonus when parrying a weapon attack with the staff, unless some sort of feat which dictates otherwise is in play.
