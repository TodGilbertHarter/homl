TRAITS/
The rogue is a character who survives by his quick wits, cunning, and a good eye with a shiv when push comes to shove. Rogues never like a fight that has even odds. They prefer to surprise their enemies, attack from the flanks, or snipe from the shadows. When not engaged in a fight they tend to be glib, fast talking, and freewheeling types. Many have a dark past, but many also hide a good heart beneath a hard exterior.
