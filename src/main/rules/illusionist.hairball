TRAITS/
The illusionist is a wielder of shadow magic, but unlike the necromancer he focuses on the mind-affecting aspects of shadow. Thus illusionists are masters of deception, illusion, and misdirection. When in the presence of an illusionist, nothing is as it seems! 

Illusion magic has a reputation for being frightening and its practitioners are often held in ill-repute. This reputation may be often deserved, but some of those with a talent for this kind of magic have resolved to use it for good ends. It is a difficult path to follow as suspicion will never be far away, and the temptation to cloud the minds and judgment of even one's friends and allies can be a deadly temptation. As ever, the path of shadow is both powerful and treacherous.
