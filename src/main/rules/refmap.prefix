/*
This file is a PREFIX for the refmap.hairball file. We will GENERATE refmap.hairball by taking a copy of this
file, and then appending to it the output of running genrefs.hairball against the main document. The result should
be a hairball file which will populate a reference map of the main document, letting us do lookups from names of
document content elements to recover their ids. This table can then be used during the main document generation
pass to resolve internal links, etc. without needing to hand-code ids into document source.

Note that I am putting all reference/id related code in here just to isolate things better. This way the main document
code doesn't have to know anything about the 'black magic' of how references and IDs actually work.
