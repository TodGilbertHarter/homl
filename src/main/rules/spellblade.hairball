TRAITS/
The spell blade is a magic infused warrior who utilizes elemental power in order to give her weapon attacks great force. The arcane magics bound up into this rune weapon also give her fantastical powers with which to confront her enemies.

Spell blades follow ancient traditions once perfected by lost races who used arts long forgotten by all others to empower themselves. By studying the arcane secrets of magic they were able to harness the power of elements to both attack and defend. Only a very few of these mighty warriors still exist, and you have been granted access to their secrets.
