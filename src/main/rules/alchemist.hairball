Alchemists are experimenters with magical substances and devices. Using their mastery of elemental forces they are experts at combining ingredients and infusing them with magical power. Many alchemists create items as well as infusing ritual magic into consumables. Often their experiments are dangerous, or require strange ingredients. 

As an alchemist a character may be driven to study unusual creatures, substances, devices, and such in order to increase her knowledge and power. Often this calling is a way for those who simply love knowledge for its own sake to make their way in the world. Others have more focused agendas or merely seek power.
