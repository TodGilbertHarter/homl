/CHAPTER" Heroic Origins "/

Every hero has a heroic origin, a starting point which differentiates them from other mortals. The details of this story are entirely up to the character's player, but this
chapter provides a group of templates and elements which can be used to build these origin stories. Additionally it defines the sorts of /REF Boons REF/ , 
feats, knacks, and possibly other character traits which follow from this choice.

Heroic origins have associated background elements. Various heroic origins will note certain specific appropriate options. Most heroes will thus have at least a couple of these
defined. Players are free to use the other background elements as they see fit, but since they are not part of the character's core selections they won't normally provide any
substantial benefits, such as access to knacks, etc. Some exceptions may be noted which should be considered as being part of the hero's origin.

Every origin provides at least one knack as a feature. Some may also provide access to major boons or a special origin-specific feature. They might also include things like
equipment, wealth, or other such minor boons. If an origin does not specify a minor boon, then take one which is noted as associated with one of the hero's background
elements.

/LABEL Backgrounds as Boons LABEL/ Sometimes a character may spend a lot of time in an area, work in a new profession, etc. When this happens the GM could grant a 
relevant background element as a minor boon. 

/LABEL Knowledge LABEL/ Characters are assumed to have learned something from their origin. Thus when they confront a situation where a check is required and it is 
related specifically to one of their background elements, they are assumed to have a +5 proficiency bonus, just as if they were proficient. Thus a character who was a farmer 
might get a +5 bonus to a check to figure out what is wrong with a cow, for example.

God Spawned are literally children of the gods, the product of the physical union of a deity and a mortal of some kind, usually a human. As such the God Spawned has a strong
and direct connection with fate and usually a heroic destiny of some kind. God Spawned can be of any calling, but often take after their divine parent to some degree, both in
terms of calling and general personality. The gods rarely recognize their children by mortals, at least not until the child has proven herself to possess the qualities of
greatness. As such all God Spawned have a birth background trait of Orphan or Adopted. 

Those who are orphans may have been abandoned by their mortal parent, or perhaps the mortal parent died, or was unaware of the existence of the child. Those who are adopted
may have one of their parents, the mortal one, and another mortal step-parent who is likely unaware of the God Spawned's nature. 

Does the hero know of his parentage? Is he in danger, and if so from whom? Can she prove herself to her divine parent? Does she want to?

The player should determine who the hero's divine parent is and base their determination as to a knack, weapon, and implement proficiency based on that choice, as well as 
any other interesting background traits.

A Half Dragon is a humanoid mortal with a significant draconic heritage. In some cases they are the product of a direct union between a mortal and a dragon, but it is also
possible that the hero is more distantly related to dragons. The Half Dragon may even be a throwback to a time when her line had considerably more draconic blood than is now
the case.

What sort of dragon are you descended from? How did this union take place? When?
