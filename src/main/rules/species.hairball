/CHAPTER" Species "/

Every character is a member of some species, which the player will choose when first building the character. A species designates a unique kind of being, like an elf, a human, or a dragon. Species choice allows the player to choose certain options associated with that kind of creature, and it will probably also color the way the character is played. Every species has some traits which are common to its members, but remember, the world is a magical place; there are no rules of biology and genetics which dictate that every elf will have the same species traits as every other one, or that species itself must be established by heredity, etc. Some species are exceptionally mutable and may not even be biological at all! 

Instead think of species as a starting point. If your character is human, he's probably similar to other humans. He probably has parents, and he probably looks like them and his personality and other attributes are probably similar to theirs. However, the world of HoML is magical, and fantastic, and it is possible he's a changeling, or somehow touched by fate. Maybe he was raised by elves and shares some traits with them. As with other categories, these are intended more as a starting point, baseline, and something you can use when elaborating on this character element isn't desired. Your character could be a generic dwarf, or he could be a very special unique dwarf with characteristics different from other dwarves.
