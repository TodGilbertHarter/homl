/CHAPTER" Species "/

Every character is a member of some species, which the player will choose when first building the character. A species designates a unique kind of being, like an elf, a human, or a dragon. Species choice allows the player to choose certain options associated with that kind of creature, and it will probably also color the way the character is played. Every species has some traits which are common to its members, but remember, the world is a magical place; there are no rules of biology and genetics which dictate that every elf will have the same species traits as every other one, or that species itself must be established by heredity, etc. Some species are exceptionally mutable and may not even be biological at all! 

Instead think of species as a starting point. If your character is human, he's probably similar to other humans. He probably has parents, and he probably looks like them and his personality and other attributes are probably similar to theirs. However, the world of HoML is magical, and fantastic, and it is possible he's a changeling, or somehow touched by fate. Maybe he was raised by elves and shares some traits with them. As with other categories, these are intended more as a starting point, baseline, and something you can use when elaborating on this character element isn't desired. Your character could be a generic dwarf, or he could be a very special unique dwarf with characteristics different from other dwarves.

TRAITS/
Humans are typical inhabitants of the world. They are ordinary people. In many settings humans are the most common or even the only race which exists. Humans are the assumed baseline for player characters. Where other races differ from humans they are provided with racial attributes and limitations which illustrate those differences. Human heroes are likely to have any calling.
/SUBSECTION" Culture "/

Human cultures are highly varied and humans are quick to adapt, adopting practices and ideas from other humans, or even other species, relatively quickly and easily. Many human cultures have included non-humans and here too humans tend to be relatively flexible; at the same time humans can be quite militant and stubborn about their values and practices. They are often quite willing to go to war over a cultural dispute, yet a couple of decades later they may change their attitudes entirely, making one wonder what the fuss was about.

In religious practices humans are likewise both flexible and opinionated. While a human culture may quickly accept a new religious idea, or a new god, on the one hand, an individual human may prove to be quite ready to die rather than change her beliefs one iota. Humans tend to make a big show of their religious activities, building large temples and holding elaborate rituals; priesthoods are often highly organized and influential in human societies.

Humans adopt a wide variety of different social organization types. Some live in small family groups with little other organization. Other humans live in large societies with a high degree of organization and social structure where each person belongs to a distinct social group. Likewise humans employ a wide variety of political systems; one region may be a despotism, completely with slavery; another region may be organized as a feudal monarchy; and a third might be a republic.

In game terms backgrounds of any social class, occupation, etc. are potentially open to all humans.

TRAITS/
The wose are a race of beings unlike the more fleshly races of men, eldar, and dwarves. Their bodies are more vegetable in nature than those of the other races, and they look quite plantlike, with skin which resembles, bark, moss, or sometimes stone. 

Wose are originally creatures of the deep forest, and they are most at home in wooded glens, thick forests, and even dense jungles and wooded swamps. From time to time they are seen in other territories, however, and they are perfectly capable of surviving in a variety of habitats if they must.

The origins and history of the wose race is an obscure one. While they are accomplished lore-masters in their own way they rarely produce written works and usually have limited contact with humanoid races such as humans. While their are reports of these creatures going back many centuries it is only recently that they have appeared in considerable numbers and come to the attention of men in general.

The truth is that the wose race has existed in small numbers, mostly in the realm of Fairy for many ages, but in recent times they have entered the natural world in force, heeding the call of the nature spirits they call their creators to come and protect the world from those who would ravage the forests and the land.
/SUBSECTION" Culture"/

Wose culture is rather different from that of creatures like humans. Although they do produce things, and have communities, individual wose are able to fairly easily exist simply by standing in a favorable location and soaking up the sunlight. They are not, therefor, compelled to order themselves into complex productive communities with elaborate economies. Instead the wose seem more driven by their essential nature. They travel the wild forested lands of the world(s) acting as wardens, tending to the woods wherever they go.

This doesn't mean that the wose have no community, but it is more likely to be organized around and driven by concerns related to this natural drive. Thus there are orders and schools of wose who pursue various strategies and hone a variety of different traditional skills which they use in their mission. These various groups don't always see eye-to-eye either. There can be rather significant differences of opinion over questions of approach and strategy, or acceptable practices.

Another factor is that wose don't have a particularly strong emphasis on families and biological relations. A new wose is planted by its seed mother, and then left to emerge as a sapling and find its own way in the world. The upshot being that orders, schools, circles, and looser associations based on individual loyalty, reputation, convergence of interests and beliefs, etc. play the dominant role in their society.

Thus a wose may be known for having specific skills, but they don't really fall into well-defined socio-economic groupings. There are elders who have superior skills and knowledge, but they are not, per se, vested with political power and there are no such things as titles analogous to those amongst humans. Instead wose have stories, which are vast long utterances that detail their various experiences, alliances, affiliations, accomplishments, and stories. Since individual wose may live for an indefinite time period these stories can become quite long and complex. It is said that the eldest of the wose would require days to recount their names!
/TOPIC" Backgrounds"/

Wose would most likely have backgrounds related to hunting, tracking, or various sorts of crafting. They do have forms of entertainment, mostly relating to retelling of old histories and lore in oral form.

/SUBSECTION" Varieties"/

There are 3 separate types of wose, the ancients who are the oldest ancestral form of the race, and two newer forms, the hunters and the guardians. All wose have a basically humanoid appearance. They walk upright on two leg-like limbs and possess arms roughly similar to those of humanoids. Their hands and feet are irregular and varying in shape, but all have a number of root-like fingers and toes. Their heads are often somewhat oddly shaped, square, lopsided, or craggy and stone-like. Their eyes are deep-set and have the appearance of polished stone or deep pools of water with no white showing.

/TOPIC" Ancients"/
appear greenish or gray and their skin appears to be covered in moss, while on their heads a tangle of vine-like material, usually tangled with a few leaves, has the appearance of hair. Their eyes look like gazing into a deep pool, ranging from a medium blue color to pitch black. Ancients tend to have a medium build.
TOPIC/
/TOPIC" Hunters"/
appear woody and their skin is bark-like in appearance. Their heads are covered in a twiggy mass which has the appearance of a tangle of small shrubby branches. A hunter's eyes have catlike pupils and an iris varying from grayish green to dark green or dark amber. Hunters are generally the tallest and thinnest of the wose.
TOPIC/
/TOPIC" Guardians"/
appear stony and there skin has the consistency of rock, usually looking a bit like lichen-stained granite or sometimes limestone. The eyes of guardians have a dry stony look to them as well, though they do appear slightly polished. The iris is usually grayish red to dark red in color. Guardians are usually the shortest of the wose, and are very heavily built, being almost dwarf-like in their proportions. Their fingers and toes are short, stubby, and stone-like, with a powerful grip.
