Priests are the servants of the gods. They are granted divine power which they use to support and protect the god's followers, defeat the god's enemies, and further the philosophy and power of their gods. In combat Priests fill the enabler role, healing and empowering their allies while dis-empowering their enemies. 

Priests gain much of their power by studying at and being initiated by different altars. Each god has many altars scattered around the lands which can grant spells of different types and levels. When a priest first reaches a particular altar she will need to perform some sort of ritual or sacrifice in order to tap the power of that particular altar. Once the requirements for the altar are met and a certain amount of prayer is completed the character will be granted a boon allowing the casting of spells of certain levels and domains. The GM has a chart which lists a number of known altars, their requirements, and the boons they can provide. 

Each priest should select a god, or possibly several gods, to which she is dedicated. Some deities may normally impose racial or other limitations on their priests, although in many cases heroes break the mold.  Each deity has a primary sphere of influence over which they preside. A level 1 priest may start with a generic level 1 boon as a class feature from this primary sphere. If the priest worships a group of deities, or one with multiple domains, then he could pick multiple domain boons.
