The berserker is a warrior who is able to enter into a special mental state in which he can fight with extraordinary ferocity. Usually hailing from less urbanized warrior cultures berserkers often charge recklessly into battle with little regard for their own safety. While they wield weapons in battle and consider themselves to be warriors, their power comes primarily from their relationship to the life force within themselves and others, as distinct from the martial traditions of discipline and practice common to knights and such. Thus they don't come across, generally, as disciplined or thoughtful fighters, instead relying on frontal attacks, shock tactics, and the sheer power of their aura and reputation for ferocity.

Most berserkers associate themselves with a totemic animal tradition, such as the wolf, or bear, which gives them additional benefits. Others might tap more directly into the natural world, becoming something like the essence of the life force in their chosen environment. This sort of berserker might take on verious sorts of transformations.
