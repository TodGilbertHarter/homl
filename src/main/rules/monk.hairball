Monks are individuals who seek to perfect their inner selves by means of meditation and practice. Those who become heroes rely on this extreme training and esoteric techniques learned through long practice in ancient fighting traditions. They usually belong to schools or traditions of study and are generally very loyal to their teachers. They may decide to go out into the world for various reasons, leaving their isolated training locations. This could be because of some quest given to them by their teachers, a disaster or attack which destroys their home, or simply because they have a desire to accomplish some goal out in the world.

Most monks start out with very little in the way of material resources, and they have a reputation for being uninterested in material wealth. However, they might acquire certain gear and magical accoutrements in the course of their lives as heroes.

/BENEFITS
/BENEFIT
You can stop taking turns in an action sequence, or stop the effects of the passage of time outside of combat. This pause will last for an appropriate period of time. If the time period becomes significant, you may need to make a Survival check to determine if you can remain in the timeless state until the desired moment; this check would be part of whatever challenge involves stakes related to your waking appropriately. If used in combat, this ability results in your character gaining the helpless condition, but because you do not take turns, you cannot for instance die from the progressing effects of a poison. At the end of the combat, or as appropriate, you will awaken and any conditions, effects, or afflictions which were delayed begin again, as if no time had passed. During the suspension you won't need air or food, etc. but adverse environmental conditions or attacks will still do damage, etc. though negative effects of conditions such as weather or moderate cold will not be felt.
