TRAITS/
The knight is a classic warrior who specializes in close melee fighting. He may or may not be mounted, and in some cultures he might sport heavy armor, a bow, or other variations, but his primary focus is his ability to go toe-to-toe with his enemies and beat them. As a defender his main purpose is to keep the enemy occupied, damage them, and prevent them from moving past him or attacking his allies.

Knights never shrink from battle willingly, they have been well trained and consider it their highest calling to test their mettle against powerful foes. Their combat role is defender, they stand in the front line of the fight and shield their teammates from harm, while attacking the enemy. If an opponent ignores the knight, then he opens himself up for even worse punishment.

Outside of combat situations knights are respected and generally treated with deference. Other knights and respectable folk will give them assistance. Once a knight has been recognized officially as a bona fide knight, and earned his spurs, he will be given shelter and aid by all who support the cause of law and order. Knights who gain bad reputations, for being dishonorable or failing to uphold their social obligations on the other hand, might find themselves scorned or even attacked on sight.

/DESCRIPTION You have been 'dubbed' or enrolled in the Order of Knighthood by a peer or lord. You are now considered to be a member of the elite social class of warriors known as knights. DESCRIPTION/
/BENEFITS
/BENEFIT
You obtain the services of a squire. The squire is a companion character of your level who is a minion. He (or she) does not deliberately engage in combat, and if injured (losing their one minion hit point) can be depicted as fleeing or hiding. Death of a squire is a great dishonor for the knight. Squires will care for the character's equipment, cook, guard their horse, etc. The squire comes with a riding horse of his own, assuming that the knight is also equipped with a mount. The squire comes from another knightly family, who will always hold you in high regard for training and caring for their child's warrior education. While you may leave your squire in a safe place for a time if necessary, neglecting them entirely will have negative social consequences.
BENEFIT/
/BENEFIT
You are granted a fee, which is a small area of land, including farm buildings, a residence, and a few servants and tenants.

Characters with wealth above +2 don't get a specific benefit to their wealth, but they do gain access to the residence and servants when they reside on their fee.
