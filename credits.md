## Art

Some of the artwork used in HoML was originally produced and placed in the public domain by Stephane Richard. All other
artwork utilized in HoML is believed to be in the public domain.

## Code

The javascript router used by the HoML site is largely based on an article published by Riccardo Canella.

## Libraries

A number of libraries are used in HoML. See also the Hairball project, upon which this one depends.

Many other projects and libraries are also relied on as indirect dependencies. We
would like to state our appreciation for all their hard work, without which none of
our efforts would be possible.

## Tooling

HoML and Hairball were created using Eclipse, GIT, GitHub, Gradle, OpenJDK,
GraalVM Community Edition, and of course GNU/Linux and all the associated tools
and libraries. Additionally we used Mozilla Firefox in the development of the
client side web components, as well as the Chromium browser. Large parts of the
HoML application rely on Firebase infrastructure and tools, including Google's
various command line utilities, etc.
